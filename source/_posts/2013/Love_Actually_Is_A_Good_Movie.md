title: Love Actually is All Around

>Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world,
I think about the arrivals gate at Heathrow airport.
General opinion makes out that we live in a world of hatred and greed, but I don't see that. Seems to me that love is everywhere. 
Often it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy but it's alwas there.
Fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends.
When the planes hits the Twin Towers, as far as I know, none of the phone calss from people on board were messages of hate or revenge, they were all messages of love.
If you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling you'll find that love actually is all around.

这是电影*Love Actually*开始的时候，在片中饰演英国首相的Hugh Grant做的旁白。

>I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes
Christmas is all around me 
And so the feeling grows
It's written on the wind
It's everywhere I go
So if you really love Christmas
Come on and let it snow

这是电影开始时，片中的摇滚明星Billy在录音室唱的歌。

大学的时候英语系有个外教每周周五晚会在一个教室用投影给大家放电影，这个活动是开放的，所以那个时候，只要周五晚有空都会过去看电影。第一次看*Love Actually*就是在那个时候，之后好像每个圣诞节都会回顾一下这部圣诞电影。

*Love Actually*是最适合圣诞节时看的大杂烩爱情喜剧了。不管是首相，作家，摇滚歌手，中产阶级，穷屌丝都能在圣诞节前皆大欢喜的找到真爱。这片让我觉得英国人的爱情观比美国人还开放。片中各种熟悉的面孔。这是第二次看，才发现，「神探夏洛克」里的华生也在其中。
